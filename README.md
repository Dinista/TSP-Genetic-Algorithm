# TSP-Genetic-Algorithm

## Introduction
Consist in a genetic algorithm implementation to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.
All the code was written in python, and an portuguese article was written comparing result of specific inputs.

<b>Second project of the class Algorithmic Modeling and Optimization.</b>

## The problem
<p>The travelling salesman problem (TSP), is a well known problem in the field. It can be resume in one question:</p>
<p>"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"</p>
<p>The code representation of this problem is a graph, where each node is a city and each edge is a path between cities. There're many techniques that can be applied to this problem, even though it's categorized as NP-complete.</p>
